# myWords

This is a Java Swing GUI project for starter English learners in Turkish. 
The app allows the user to add words to the system that they want to learn.
There exists 3 different levels of difficulty and the user can generate tests
according to the desired difficulty.
There exists a basic ai that determines which words will be asked to the user according to the desired difficulty level.
For design, neo-brutalism style was chosen.

If you want to use the code in any of your projects, feel free to copy-paste any part. You might have a problem with the images as the paths to them 
are specific to my computer. I will add the images in a seperate file though, you can use them as you wish.
